Project build with scss and html since it is a static web page that includes variables

To get started, run:

```
npm i
npm run watch
```

Do not edit the styles.css file, edit the styles.scss file and after you run the above commands, the styles.css file is automatically updated.

Then, just run the HTML file. If on VSCode, you can download the Live Server extension so whenever files update, HTML frontend updates
